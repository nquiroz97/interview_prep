binary search offers the searching benefit of an ordered array, as well as 
 the inserting and deleting benefits of a linked list 
tree structure is not sequential, also called a non-binary tree, since they have more than 2 children
 binary only allows for two children max
      
            A      - is the root node, level 0
          /   \ 
         B     C     - child node, level 1
       / | \   <-------------------------------------------- this is a subtree
      D  F  G  - leaf nodes since they do not have any children, level 2

      - depth for leaf node D would be 2(count number of /'s(called edges or paths))

        Parent              left child value must be less than parent value, whereas right child must be greater than parent value
