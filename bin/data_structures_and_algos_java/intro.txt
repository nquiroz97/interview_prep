- A data structure organizes and stores data and each has strengths and weaknesses
- An algorithm describes the steps needed to be taken to perform or accomplish a specific task
  there can be many algorithms that accomplish the same task 

 Example: Making tea 
 1. Boil water
 2. Add teabag to cup
 3. Pour the boiling water to cup
 4. Remove the teabag when tea is ready
 5. Add the desired amount of milk to the cup
 6. A the desired amount of sugar to the cup
 7. Stir the contents of the cup with a spoon

 ** an algorithm is not the implementation ** 

 - The implementation is the code written to perform the steps, there can be many implementations 
   of the same algorithm
