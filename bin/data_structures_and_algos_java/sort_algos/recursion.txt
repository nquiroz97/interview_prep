A method is a recursive method when it calls itself

Example: Factorial Algorithm
** the factorial for negative numbers are undefined **
1. If num is equal to 0, The factorial is 1. Stop.
   Otherwise...
2. set multiplier to 1
3. set factorial to 1
4. while multiplier is not equal to num , do steps 5 and 6
5. multiply factorial by multiplier and assign the result to factorial
6. add 1 to multiplier
7. stop. the result is a factorial
