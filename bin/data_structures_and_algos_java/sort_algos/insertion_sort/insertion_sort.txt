Insertion sort grows a sorted partition from the front of the array, work is done in 
the sorted partition

Example: [ 20,35,-15,7,55,1,-22 ]
            Sorted --> | Unsorted -->
Starting: [ 20 | 35,-15,7,55,1,-22 ]

1. firstUnsortedIndex (starts at 1) - first index of the unsorted partition
2. i (starts at 0) - index used to traverse the sorted partition from right to left
3. newElement - the value we want to insert into the sorted partition

Insertion sort 
- in place algorithm as long as the memory does not increase as the number of 
  items in array increase(i.e no additional array has to be created, memory efficient)
- O(n^2)
- doesn't require as much swapping as bubble sort, generally will perform better than bubble
- stable algorithm, since we're traversing left to right so first duplicate will always be 
  swapped first
