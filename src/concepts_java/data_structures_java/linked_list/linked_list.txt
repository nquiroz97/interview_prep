used for storing a collection of data
-- setbacks of an array --
    - an array's size cannot be increased after it has been initialized
    - for an item to be inserted in between, array will have to be iterated 
        through and reassign new indexes to the elements

- a linked list allows to insert at the head(first position), the tail(last position)
   and in between and the rest of the will be reassigned automatically
- there's no fixed size limitation
- linked list nodes are composed of two things: the value and the pointer
- a pointer if a reference to another place in memory(object || node)

- in a singly and circular linked list, the nodes only know about the next node, not the one
     preceding it 
- doubly linked lists, the nodes are aware of the ones following and preceding them
   this allows to insert in the middle of list
- searching for an element takes longer in a linked list, since we still have to traverse 
  trhough the list
