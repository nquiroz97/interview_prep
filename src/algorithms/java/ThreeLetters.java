/* Write a function 'solution' that, given two integers A and B, returns a string containing 
   exactly A letters 'a' and exactly B letters 'b' with no three consecutive letters being the same
   (in other words, no 'aaa' or 'bbb')
   
   Examples: 
   
    1. Given A=5 and B=3, your function may return 'aabaabab'. Note that 'abaabbaa' would also
       be a correct answer
    2. Given A=3 and B=3, your function should return 'ababab', 'aababb' or 'abaabb'
    3. Given A=1 and B=4, your function should return 'bbabb' which is the only correct answer
   
   Assume that:

    - A and B are integers within range [0..100];
    - atleast one solution exists
