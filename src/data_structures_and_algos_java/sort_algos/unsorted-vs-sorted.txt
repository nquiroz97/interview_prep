- stable vs unstable comes inyo play when handling duplicate values in array 
- unstable sort: relative ordering of duplicate items will not be preserved, 
  so array[2]<9> array[5]<9>, value 9 from index 5 will come before 9 value from index 2
- stable sort: relative ordering of duplicate items will be preserved, 
  so array[2]<9> array[5]<9>, value 9 from index 5 will still come after 9 value from index 2
- best case, stable is preferred over unstable

why does original relative ordering matter?
example: sort within in a sort(first sort by name then sort based on age)
-if the second sort causes the positions of duplicates from the first sort to flip, it will cause problems

normally for integers it does not matter, but if a sort algorithm is normally unstable,
make sure your implementation is not inadvertently changing it to unstable

Stable: 
- Bubble sort

Unstable:
